Key components of the backend include:

- **Conversation State Management**: Tracks the state of user interactions for multi-step operations.
- **Wallet Model**: Defines the schema for storing wallet information in the database.
- **Network-specific Handlers**: Custom logic for different blockchain networks (EVM, Bitcoin, Polkadot).
- **SDK Integration**: Wrapper functions around Chainflip SDK methods for seamless integration with bot commands.

## User Interface

FlipBot's user interface is entirely text-based, leveraging Telegram's chat interface. The bot uses a combination of text messages and custom keyboards to guide users through various operations:
